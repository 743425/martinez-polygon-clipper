This is a Scala implementation of the Martinez-Rueda polygon clipping algorithm.  
This implementation is a port from the original [w8r/martinez](https://github.com/w8r/martinez) JavaScript implementation.

This initial version has a more imperative than functional code style because of the quick port from the original JavaScript source.
