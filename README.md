# Martinez-Rueda polygon clipping algorithm [![Build Status](http://jenkins.soulfiresoftware.com/buildStatus/icon?job=martinez-polygon-clipper/master)](http://jenkins.soulfiresoftware.com/job/martinez-polygon-clipper/)

This is a Scala implementation ported from the original [w8r/martinez](https://github.com/w8r/martinez) JavaScript implementation.

This initial version has a more imperative than functional code style due to the quick port from the original JavaScript source.
